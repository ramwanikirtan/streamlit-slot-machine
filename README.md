# streamlit-slot-machine
I built this project as a web-based slot machine game using Python and Streamlit. The app features user registration, login, and persistent balances stored in a JSON file. I chose Streamlit because it allows for rapid development of interactive web apps entirely in Python, without needing to write separate HTML or JavaScript.

Technologies used:

Python 3
Streamlit (for the web interface)
JSON (for user data storage)
What I learned:

How to build interactive web apps with Streamlit
How to manage user authentication and persistent data in Python
How to structure a multi-user application
How to deploy a Python web app for free using Streamlit Community Cloud
This project helped me understand the basics of web app development, user session management, and deploying Python apps online.
