Certainly! Hereâ€™s your **updated GitHub repository description** with your live app link included:

---

> ðŸŽ° **Slot Machine Web App**
>
> I built this project as a web-based slot machine game using **Python** and **Streamlit**. The app features user registration, login, and persistent balances stored in a JSON file. I chose Streamlit because it allows for rapid development of interactive web apps entirely in Python, without needing to write separate HTML or JavaScript.
>
> **Technologies used:**  
> - Python 3  
> - Streamlit (for the web interface)  
> - JSON (for user data storage)
>
> **What I learned:**  
> - How to build interactive web apps with Streamlit  
> - How to manage user authentication and persistent data in Python  
> - How to structure a multi-user application  
> - How to deploy a Python web app for free using Streamlit Community Cloud
>
> **Live Demo:**  
> [Try the Slot Machine Web App here!](https://app-slot-machine-c6kk7fmi3mgkglthuqtfns.streamlit.app/)
>
> This project helped me understand the basics of web app development, user session management, and deploying Python apps online.
